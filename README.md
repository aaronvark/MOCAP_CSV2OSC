# MOCAP_CSV2OSC

MOCAP CSV2OSC is a small application that loads a CSV file exported from a Motive recording. The loaded CSV file can then be played back sending it's data through OSC over the netwrok in the same format as the NatNet2OSC bridge.

This application is meant to be used together with a Motive recording so you can work with MOCAP data without having the acces to a MOCAP instalaltion.
